# PESMOD
**PESMOD** (**PE**xels **S**mall **M**oving **O**bject **D**etection) dataset consists of high resolution aerial images in which moving objects are labelled manually. The aim of this work is to provide a different and challenging dataset for moving object detection methods evaluation. Each moving object is labelled for each frame with PASCAL VOC format in a XML file. Dataset consists of 8 sequence detailed below.
